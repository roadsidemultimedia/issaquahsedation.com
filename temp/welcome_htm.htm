Dr. Ajay started his career in dentistry in 1992, attending a 5-yr Degree program to earn his BDS (Baccalaureate in Dental Surgery). He then finished a year-long General Practice Residency in 1998 in India. Being a strong believer that "Education is a Continuous Process," in 2003 he completed his DDS (Doctorate in Dental Surgery) from the prestigious Loma Linda University in California, where he attended their Advanced Standing Program and was awarded the Academic Excellence Award.</p>

<p>He is a Member of the Academy of General Dentistry, and an Associate Fellow of World Clinical Laser Institute. Along with the privilege of practicing dentistry, he also has a License in the State of Washington for IV Sedation and is an active member of the Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation. He holds ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) certifications from the American Heart Association.</p>

<p>Dr. Ajay's quest for knowledge is the driving force that has led him to pursue his never-ending journey of skill enhancement and talent refinement to stay abreast of the latest literature, research, technique and technology. </p>

<p>Dr. Rehan Bashar started his now distinguished career as a dental professional after graduating with a BDS degree on a commonwealth scholarship in 1993 from Sri Lanka. He was in private practice for the next four years. In 1997 he then joined Dow Medical College, Karachi, as the Chief Resident, Dept. of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Dr. Bashar continued his education at the prestigious Loma Linda University in Southern California to pursue his quest for knowledge. His talent has been noticed and won him the Clinical Excellence Award. He graduated with a DDS degree in 2002 and was one of the few individuals in the Endodontic Honors Program.</p>

<p>Dr. Rehan has been practicing dentistry in Seattle since 2002. He believes in being on top of his profession and continues to pursue education every day. He obtained his Invisalign Orthodontic certification and now is enrolled in a year-long Implant Consortium.</p>
